cottage n. /'kɔtidʤ/  nhà tranh/
cotton n. /ˈkɒtn/ bông, chỉ, sợi/~~a plant grown in warm countries for the soft white hairs around its seeds that are used to make cloth and thread In the 19th century the cotton industry made the north-west of England one of the richest areas in the world. The cotton arrived at the port of Liverpool, was made into clothes in factories in Lancashire, and the clothes could be sent to other countries from Liverpool. The new inventions of the Industrial Revolution meant that the Lancashire factories could produce cotton goods and sell them around the world at lower prices than local goods. In the 20th century many other countries developed their own cotton industries, and most of the Lancashire factories closed.In the US, the production of cotton was greatly improved after Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin (= a machine for separating the seeds of a cotton plant from the cotton). The economy of the South was strongly based on cotton in the 19th century, and this led to the Civil War because the cotton plantations (= large farms) kept slaves. When the boll weevil insects destroyed many cotton fields in the early 20th century, Southern farmers began to grow other crops.~cotton fields/plants~bales of cotton~~the cloth made from the cotton plant~The sheets are 100% pure cotton.~a cotton shirt/skirt~printed cotton cloth~the cotton industry~a cotton mill~a pure cotton T-shirt~shivering in her thin cotton nightdress~~thread that is used for sewing~sewing cotton~a cotton reel~~a soft mass of white material that is used for cleaning the skin or a wound~Use a cotton ball to apply the lotion.

Several kings found that they did not have enough money, and so they called together representatives from counties and towns in England to ask them to approve taxes. Over time, the noblemen became the House of Lords and the representatives became the House of Commons. The rise of political parties in the 18th century led to less control and involvement of the sovereign, leaving government in the hands of the cabinet led by the prime minister. Although the UK is still officially governed by Her Majesty's Government, the Queen does not have any real control over what happens in Parliament. Both the House of Lords and the House of Commons meet in the Palace of Westminster, also called the Houses of Parliament, in chambers with several rows of seats facing each other where members of the government sit on one side and members of the Opposition sit on the other. Each period of government, also called a parliament, lasts a maximum of five years and is divided into one-year periods called sessions.~a Member of Parliament~The issue was debated in Parliament.~an Act of Parliament~to win a seat in Parliament~to be elected to Parliament~~a particular period during which a parliament is working; Parliament as it exists between one general election and the next~We are now into the second half of the parliament.~to dissolve Parliament (= formally end its activities) and call an election
